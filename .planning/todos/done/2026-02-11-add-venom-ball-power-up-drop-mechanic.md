title: Add venom ball power-up drop mechanic
area: general

## Problem

Currently venom is spit as a stream/line. There's no way to change how venom behaves during gameplay. Adding a collectible power-up drop would introduce more variety and strategic depth to the venom mechanic.

## Solution

Add a random drop item that appears on the board with a "B" label on it. When a snake eats this drop, their venom changes from the default behavior to shooting balls instead. Key considerations:

- New drop type: a "B"-labeled collectible that spawns randomly on the board (similar to apple spawning)
- When collected, modifies the snake's venom type to "ball" mode
- Venom balls would behave differently from standard venom (projectile shape/physics)
- Could be temporary (timed power-up) or permanent until death — TBD
- Needs visual distinction so players can tell when a snake has ball venom
