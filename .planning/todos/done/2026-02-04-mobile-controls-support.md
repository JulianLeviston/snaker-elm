## Problem

Mobile devices cannot play the game because:
1. No on-screen control buttons for touch input
2. Swipe gestures are not implemented

The game is currently desktop-only with keyboard controls (arrow keys / WASD).

## Solution

TBD - Needs discussion on approach:
- On-screen D-pad or arrow buttons?
- Swipe gesture detection?
- Both options?
- Touch area positioning (not blocking game view)
