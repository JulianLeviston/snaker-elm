title: Improve mobile responsive layout

## Problem

The game screen size doesn't work well on mobile devices. The layout needs to be responsive but there are competing concerns:

1. Game canvas may be too small or poorly sized on mobile screens
2. QR code and connection UI take up valuable screen real estate
3. Need to balance game visibility with sharing/connection features

## Solution

TBD - Needs design discussion:
- Stretch game canvas to fit screen width?
- Collapse/hide QR code after connection established?
- Different layout for portrait vs landscape?
- Scrollable sections vs everything visible?
- Mobile-specific simplified UI?
