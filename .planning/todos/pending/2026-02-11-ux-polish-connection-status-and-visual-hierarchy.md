title: UX polish connection status and visual hierarchy
area: ui
files: []
---

## Problem

The connection status display is positioned below the game area, making it easy to miss. The overall visual hierarchy of the UI could be improved so players can quickly see the most important information (game state, connection status, player list) at a glance.

## Solution

- Move connection status indicator to the top of the game area where it's immediately visible
- Review and improve the visual hierarchy of UI elements (size, color, positioning)
- Ensure critical information (connection state, errors) is prominent without being intrusive
