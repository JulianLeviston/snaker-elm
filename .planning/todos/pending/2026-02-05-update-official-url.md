title: Update repo to reference official live URL

## Problem

The repository needs to reference https://www.genericoverlords.com/snaker as the official URL for the live version of the game. This ensures users and contributors know where to find the deployed application.

## Solution

- Update README.md with the official URL
- Check for any other documentation files that should reference the live URL
- Consider adding a "Play Now" or "Live Demo" link prominently
