title: Visual effects enhancement fades highlights transitions
area: ui

## Problem

The game currently lacks visual polish in its animations and transitions. Events like scoring, death, power-up collection, and state changes happen abruptly without smooth visual feedback.

## Solution

- Add fade effects for game state transitions (e.g., death, respawn)
- Add highlight effects for important events (scoring, collecting items)
- Smooth transitions between UI states
- Consider CSS animations or Elm-driven animation for consistency with the architecture
