title: Add changelog and about page with attribution
area: ui

## Problem

The game currently has no changelog to communicate updates to users, and no about page to explain who made it and why. Users don't know what's changed between versions, and there's no attribution or context about the project's origins.

## Solution

Add two new pages/sections:

1. **Changelog** - List of version updates (v1, v2, etc.) with brief descriptions of what changed

2. **About page** with:
   - "By" link mentioning Get Contented (the creator/company)
   - The idea behind why the game was made
   - Project backstory/motivation

Could be accessible via a menu, footer link, or info icon in the UI.
