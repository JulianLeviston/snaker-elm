## Problem

The UI is functional but visually rough. Buttons, panels, text, and layout could use general styling improvements to feel more polished and cohesive.

## Solution

- Review and improve overall styling consistency (colors, spacing, typography)
- Polish button styles, input fields, and interactive elements
- Improve layout and spacing for a cleaner look
- Ensure consistent styling across different game modes and screens
